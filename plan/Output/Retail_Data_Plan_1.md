# Retail_Data Hive to PySpark Migration Plan

**Unable to generate documentation for "Retail_Data" because the Hive â†’ PySpark Analysis report is not found in the analysis output directory. Please provide the exact file name and extension for the analysis report so I can proceed with plan generation.**

---

If you have the analysis report, please upload it to the analysis output directory with a clear file name and extension (e.g., Retail_Data_Analysis_1.md, .txt, or .json). Once available, I will proceed with the full planning and estimation process as described in the workflow.
