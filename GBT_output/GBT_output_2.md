### Notes:
- **input_SET_DEFAULT_KEYS** is the mapplet input and provides three fields: `PARENT_DIM_CK` (decimal, 38), `NATURAL_KEY_NULL_IND` (string, 1), and `NULL_ALLOWED_IND` (string, 1). These are indicators and keys for downstream logic.
- **exp_PARENT_KEY_ASSIGNMENT** is an Expression transformation that:
    - Validates that `NATURAL_KEY_NULL_IND` and `NULL_ALLOWED_IND` are either 'Y' or 'N'.
    - Assigns the output `PARENT_DIM_CK` based on the presence of a parent key and the indicator values, mapping to -1, -2, or -3 for default dimension records.
    - Uses variables `v_NATURAL_KEY_NULL_IND` and `v_NULL_ALLOWED_IND` for intermediate logic.
- **output_SET_DEFAULT_KEYS** is the mapplet output, passing through the calculated `PARENT_DIM_CK`.
- **Connections:**
    - Data flows from `input_SET_DEFAULT_KEYS` to `exp_PARENT_KEY_ASSIGNMENT`, then to `output_SET_DEFAULT_KEYS`.
- **N/A fields:**
    - Where a component does not have input or output ports, or expressions, 'N/A' is used as per instructions.
- **Advanced Properties:**
    - All components are marked as Optional (true).
    - The Expression transformation has Tracing Level set to Normal.
- **No unsupported or missing properties** were found in this mapping. All required metadata is present.
