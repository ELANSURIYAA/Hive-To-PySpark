Model: gpt-4-1106-preview
Input tokens: [TO BE FILLED]
Output tokens: [TO BE FILLED]
Pricing: $0.01 per 1K input tokens, $0.03 per 1K output tokens
Formula:
  Total Cost = (Input tokens / 1000) * $0.01 + (Output tokens / 1000) * $0.03
Example:
  If input = 8000 tokens, output = 3000 tokens:
  Cost = (8 * 0.01) + (3 * 0.03) = $0.08 + $0.09 = $0.17
