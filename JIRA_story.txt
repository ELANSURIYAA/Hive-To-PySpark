Title: Extend BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT Logic to Integrate New Source Table

Business Requirement:
To improve compliance and audit readiness, a new Oracle source table BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS has been introduced. This table includes branch-level operational metadata (e.g., region, manager name, audit date, active status) and needs to be integrated into the existing ETL pipeline.

This impacts the BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT table, where:

Two new columns — REGION and LAST_AUDIT_DATE — will be added.
The existing Scala processing logic needs to be enhanced to:
Join the new table using BRANCH_ID
Populate the new columns conditionally based on IS_ACTIVE = 'Y'
Acceptance Criteria:

BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT schema is updated with new columns
ETL job successfully integrates BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS data
Backward compatibility with older records is maintained
Impact Areas:

Scala ETL logic
Delta table structure
Data validation and reconciliation routines
